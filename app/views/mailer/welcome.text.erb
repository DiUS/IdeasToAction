Hello,

Welcome to TEDxUltimo and congratulations on becoming part of the TEDx Community.  We hope to make this TEDx the ultimate place to start something.

For those who are inspired to get involved, we're asking you to find a talk from today that inspires you.  Select an idea that has been curated by the speaker and create an action that youâ€™d like to take which is your way of furthering that idea.  For example, under an idea relating to education, you might like to say "I'm going to teach 10 friends how to say 'hello' in another language."

We'll be asking you to pick a date you'd like to have this done by, from now until December. Once you've completed your action we'll share that on our website for the rest of our community to see, and give you the hashtag '#startsomething' to tweet about it too.

We're looking forward to seeing you change the world!

Thanks,


The TEDxUltimo Team
