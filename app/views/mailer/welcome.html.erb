Hello,
</p>

<p>
Welcome to TEDxUltimo and congratulations on becoming part of the TEDx Community.  We hope to make this TEDx the ultimate place to start something.
</p>

<p>
For those who are inspired to get involved, we're asking you to find a talk from today that inspires you.&nbsp; Select an idea that has been curated by the speaker and create an action that youâ€™d like to take which is your way of furthering that idea.&nbsp; For example, under an idea relating to education, you might like to say "I'm going to teach 10 friends how to say 'hello' in another language."
</p>

<p>
We'll be asking you to pick a date you'd like to have this done by, from now until December.&nbsp; Once you've completed your action we'll share that on our website for the rest of our community to see, and give you the hashtag '#startsomething' to tweet about it too.
</p>

<p>
We're looking forward to seeing you change the world!
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
</p>
