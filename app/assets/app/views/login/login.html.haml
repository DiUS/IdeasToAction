        Hello and welcome to TEDxUltimo and congratulations on becoming part of the TEDx Community.

        We've created this app to help you take an idea worth spreading and turn it into action.  
      %p
        How it works is simple:
      %p
        1. Find a talk from today that inspires you.
        2. There you’ll notice that each talk has ideas which have been curated by the speaker.
        3. Select an idea that you’d like to act upon.
        4. From there you’ll be able to create an action you can take in support of that idea by a date from now until the end of December.&nbsp; A week before your action is due we'll email you and ask you how it went.
      %p
        To get started, simply fill in your email below and you’ll be on your way to creating a positive change in the world.
