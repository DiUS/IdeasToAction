        Hi, welcome to TEDxUltimo and congratulations on becoming part of the TEDx Community. We hope to make this
        TEDx the Ultimate Place to start something.

        For those who wish to contribute to the world, we're asking you to pick an idea that you hear today - and register
        an action that you want to take to further it. For example, under an idea relating to education, you might like
        to say 'I'm going to teach 10 friends how to say 'hello' in another language'.
      %p
        We'll be asking you to pick a date you'd like to have this done by, from now until December.
      %p
        We're looking forward to seeing you change the world!
